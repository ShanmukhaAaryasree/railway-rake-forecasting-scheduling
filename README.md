## Introduction

This project leverages historical demand and operational data to build a solution for forecasting future needs and scheduling railway rakes efficiently. It targets enhanced resource utilization and more reliable freight movement within large railway systems.

## Features

- **Demand Forecasting:** Predicts future rake requirements across routes using historical data.
- **Scheduling Optimization:** Assigns available rakes to scheduled routes, improving utilization.
- **Data-Driven:** Operates on CSV datasets containing routes, schedules, rakes, and demand records.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Displays demand trends and scheduled allocations using a modern web interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend/Data:** Python, Data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Visualization:** Recharts
- **Other:** Node.js, CSV for data storage
