# Forecasting and Scheduling of Railway Rakes

## Project Overview
This project develops an intelligent system to forecast railway rake demand and optimize their scheduling for loading and unloading operations. Using machine learning techniques and real-time data integration, the system aims to minimize delays, reduce demurrage costs, and improve resource utilization in railway logistics.

## Features
- Predict rake demand using time-series forecasting (LSTM, GBM models)
- Adaptive scheduling to allocate rakes efficiently
- Real-time dashboard for monitoring rake status and operations
- Integration of external factors like weather and traffic data for enhanced accuracy
- Reports and analytics to track performance and cost savings

## Technology Stack
- Python (machine learning models)
- React.js (frontend user interface)
- Node.js (backend API services)
- MongoDB (database)
- Cloud deployment on AWS/Azure/GCP
