## Introduction

This project leverages historical demand and operational data to build a solution for forecasting future needs and scheduling railway rakes efficiently. It targets enhanced resource utilization and more reliable freight movement within large railway systems.

## Features

- **Demand Forecasting:** Predicts future rake requirements across routes using historical data.
- **Scheduling Optimization:** Assigns available rakes to scheduled routes, improving utilization.
- **Data-Driven:** Operates on CSV datasets containing routes, schedules, rakes, and demand records.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Displays demand trends and scheduled allocations using a modern web interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend/Data:** Python, Data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Visualization:** Recharts
- **Other:** Node.js, CSV for data storage

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShanmukhaAaryasree/railway-rake-forecasting-scheduling.git
   cd railway-rake-forecasting-scheduling
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

-Place or update the relevant dataset files in the data/ directory: historical_demand_data.csv, railway_rakes.csv, railway_routes.csv, railway_schedules.csv, and railway_stations.csv.

Run the backend/data scripts (Python scripts, if present) to preprocess data and generate forecasts or schedules. Detailed usage for each script (such as python src/forecast.py or python src/schedule.py) should be included in the /src folder and documented within those scripts.

Launch the frontend interface with:

text
npm run dev
This starts the development server for interacting with data visualizations and reviewing rake allocations.

Open the given local server URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser to interact with dashboards showing forecasting results and rake schedules.

For updating logic, modifying analysis, or adding new features, edit the code within the src/ directory as needed.
## Data Sources

- **historical_demand_data.csv:** Past demand for rakes per route or station.
- **railway_rakes.csv:** Details of available rakes.
- **railway_routes.csv:** Information on routes and stretches served.
- **railway_schedules.csv:** Scheduled arrival/departure and rake assignments.
- **railway_stations.csv:** List and attributes of stations.
